# PacMen-Exercise

> Version 1.0.0.1

A simple React and Formik submit-form project where the email and password fields are validated

What is being **used** in this project:
- **React** to create the whole project
- **Formik** to simplify form fields creation and validations
- **Regex** to validate field values formats

## What it does

1. If the **email** field doesn't have an email format an **"Username should be an email"** error message will appear.
2. If the **password** or **email** fields are empty an **"Required field"** error message will appear.
3. If both fields are fine, an **"Login successful"** message will pop up.
